Oh yeah! This web page is served by my awesome web server
running on my awesome OS. All home-brewed bro!
<br/>
Do you have any idea how many operations that involved?
A webserver application needed to open up a socket in listening mode and
read files from disk and serve it to you. That involved:
<ul>
<li>A virtual memory subsystem was implemented to support paging with 4k pages
<li>A stack and heap mechanism was developed.
<li>A scheduler was implemented and then a process launching system.
<li>A network card driver
<li>An interrupt management and IRQ (usign APIC) was needed
<li>Then a TCP/IP stack was created
<li>A ATA disk driver
<li>A block cache to cache any blocks read from disk (or written to).
<li>A system call mechanism to allow RING3 applications to requests OS calls.
</ul>
So you might not be impressed by this crappy web page, but it involved a shitload
of assembly and C code. There is no STL or libc in here.
