Oh yeah! This web page is served by my awesome web server
running on my awesome OS. All home-brewed bro! This machine is NOT running windows nor linux.
It is not using a POSIX kernel either. This is 100% code from scratch from the moment
the BIOS handled controlled to the boot code.

Do you have any idea how many operations that involved?
A webserver application needed to open up a socket in listening mode and
read files from disk and serve it to you. That involved:
<ul>
<li>Writing a bootloader to oot my kernel
<li>Booting the system in long mode (64bit, because by default we boot in 16bit mode)
<li>A virtual memory subsystem was implemented to support paging with 4k pages
<li>A stack and heap mechanism was developed.
<li>A scheduler was implemented and then a process launching system.
<li>A network card driver (virtio)
<li>An interrupt management and IRQ (usign APIC) was needed
<li>Then a network stack was created (This includes ARP, IP routing, sockets, TCP, UDP etc..)
<li>A virtio disk driver
<li>A block cache to cache any blocks read from disk (or written to).
<li>A system call mechanism to allow RING3 applications to requests OS calls.
</ul>
So you might not be impressed by this crappy web page, but it involved a shitload
of assembly and C code. There is no STL or libc in here.
