- heap
    - test malloc:
          create 4k buffer, 8k buffer, 100mb buffer, 2 * 30bytes buffer
          test rwite/read at begining, middle and end of each buffer
    - implement free

------------ To do later -------------------------------
- serial port: can feed console like keyboard, could make a separate flush function
- hexedit: accessing a privileged address will make it crash. 
    Should trap the exception to prevent it? 
    or should request to OS if it is permited?
- fat32 driver
- currently, ring3 apps can access kernel mem since kernel mem is not protected.
    lock kernel code, bios area, kernel data, IDT (read only)
    video mem, page tables
- block cache: the block cache is not multi-cpu friendly (see doc/blockcache)
    would need a test suite to handle all normal cases and concurrency cases
- memory pool: use it in block cache
- IRQ sharing is inneficient: ie: rtl8139 loops trhough 32 devices and checks ISR
    should stop looping when seeing first empty device and and should check ISR faster
- should reclaim unused pages such as:
    - stack pages that are no longer used.
        - just check current RSP and delete all pages below it?
    - heap pages that reside in previously freed virtual memory
- netcard driver is not multithread/multicpu safe
- remake "getTicksSinceBoot" function: use rdtsc
- kernel pages should have global flag to avoid polluting the TLB
- Possible bugs:
    -   If a process has two virt page that maps to the same phys and the thread dies,
        we will free all pages. But if we free the first mapping, then another CPU maps it
        when we arrive at the second mapping we will free it again, so other thread will lose it
    - creating more consoles than what is allowed has no error handling

============ bare metal x86_64 OS ===========================
Specifications:
    disk is a raw image with no MBR or partition
    paging uses identity mapping of the 128 first mb with 2mb pages
      and gig256-260 map to 0g-4g  
    supports ring3 user threads and ring0 kernel threads
    supports multiprocessors
    supports APIC, and not PIC
    supports PCID and does TLB shootdowns
    supports sending IPIs and registering custom handlers
    supports RTL8139 netcard on PCI bus
    on main thread:
        pressing '0' shows mem, pressing '1' launches bootscript

===================== Cool stuff to try =====================
- TCP/IP, and telnet shell
- usb driver
- disk should be partitioned with MBR
    bootloader in MBR and kernerl in partition 1   
- virtualization (nested virtualization??)
